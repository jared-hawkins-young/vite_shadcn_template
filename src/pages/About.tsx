            <div className="prose prose-lg mx-auto text-muted-foreground">
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                As a recent Computer Science graduate from UNC Charlotte with a concentration in Data Science, 
                I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and create meaningful impact. 
                My academic foundation, combined with hands-on project experience, has prepared me to contribute 
                immediately to development teams building the next generation of software solutions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                My interests span the full spectrum of modern software development, from building scalable backend 
                systems and cloud-native applications to developing intelligent AI/ML solutions that enhance user 
                experiences. I'm particularly drawn to the intersection of data science and software engineering, 
                where analytical insights drive better product decisions and user outcomes.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                What excites me most about software development is the collaborative nature of building something 
                larger than any individual could create alone. I thrive in team environments where diverse perspectives 
                come together to solve challenging problems, and I'm always eager to learn from experienced developers 
                while contributing my fresh insights and enthusiasm for emerging technologies.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                I'm actively seeking opportunities to join a development team where I can apply my technical skills, 
                continue learning, and contribute to building software that makes a positive impact on users and 
                businesses alike. Whether it's optimizing system performance, implementing machine learning models, 
                or designing intuitive user interfaces, I'm ready to tackle whatever challenges come my way.
